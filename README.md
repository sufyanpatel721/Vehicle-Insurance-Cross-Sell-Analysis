# Vehicle Insurance Cross Sell Analysis

As a budding Tableau enthusiast, I embarked on this project to delve into the world of data analysis and visualization. In this endeavor, I have explored the intriguing domain of vehicle insurance cross-selling, attempting to unravel patterns and insights within a dataset.

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of vehicle insurance cross-selling. We've employed Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to dissect the provided dataset, which contains vital information about potential customers and their interaction with the insurance offerings.

## Data Exploration

The dataset includes various features such as gender, age, driving license status, region code, prior insurance history, vehicle age, and more. Through careful data preparation and visualization, we have sought to answer important questions like:

- How does age impact the likelihood of purchasing vehicle insurance?
- Are certain gender groups more inclined to consider this offering?
- What is the relationship between vehicle damage and insurance interest?
- How does annual premium vary based on different factors?
- What are the key trends in customer behavior?

## Visualizations

Our GitHub repository features several data visualizations created in Tableau, including pie charts, bar charts, and potentially other engaging visual representations. These charts illustrate the distribution of customers and their responses to insurance offers, offering a snapshot of the insights gleaned from the data.
